# Maintainer Context & Continuity 🧠

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-01 (v3.1 Release)
**Maintainer:** Frank Jeworrek
**License Strategy:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Strict enforcement on commercial use, open for community).

## 🚀 Current State (v3.1)
We successfully transitioned from a personal "Hack" (v3.0) to a "Scalable Methodology" (v3.1).
- **Core Change:** Introduction of "Universal Patterns" (Part VI).
- **Key Files:** `templates/context/`, `templates/quality/`, `templates/prompts/`.
- **Status:** `main` is stable.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (v3.2+)
The goal is to gather **practical experience** with v3.1 in real-world projects before the next update.
- **Focus:** How do the "Advanced Patterns" hold up in daily usage?
- **Potential Updates:** Refinement of `stability-checklist`, more prompt templates.

## 🗝️ Critical Decisions Log
1.  **License Split:** We deliberately removed "MIT" references. The entire repo is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This allows us to keep control over commercial exploitation (e.g., paid courses/tools) while fostering open source adoption.
2.  **Hybrid Approach:** The *Patterns* are public, but our private *Implementations* (SessionTracker Pro) remain closed/separate. The repo only contains the *templates*, not the tooling logic.

## 🔄 How to Resume
When starting a new session to update this repo:
1.  **Read this file.**
2.  **Check `RELEASE_NOTES_v3.1.0.md`** for the last public delta.
3.  **Ask:** "What practical learnings have we gathered since Feb 2026?"

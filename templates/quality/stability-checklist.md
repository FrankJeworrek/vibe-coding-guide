License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

Before starting a new feature, verify:

1. [ ] **Git Status:** Are all previous changes committed?
2. [ ] **Tests:** Do all existing tests pass?
3. [ ] **Coverage:** Is test coverage acceptable (e.g. >70%)?
4. [ ] **TODOs:** Are there fewer than 5 critical TODOs?

> **Rule:** If you uncheck more than one, schedule a "Stabilization Session" first.
